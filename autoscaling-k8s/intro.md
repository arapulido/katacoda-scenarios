One of the advantages of using a container orchestrator like Kubernetes is the possibility of scaling our workloads depending on our application needs. Scaling our applications can be done manually by a Kubernetes administrator or we can create rules to scale our workloads automatically.

In this workshop we will be showing several ways on how to use our application metrics to make scaling decisions and automatically drive those decisions.
