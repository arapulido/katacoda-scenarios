# Welcome to the workshop "Troubleshooting Outages in Kubernetes Applications"

We have the big launch of our App today! If all gos well, we should start receiving traffic.
Your mission is to make sure that this all goes well!

All that you need are a basic working knowledge of Kubernetes, a modern web browser (which you'll be seeing this in), and your Datadog credentials.

**Note:** *The hands-on environments in Katacoda have a lifetime of 3 hours from the time you first visit.*  The work that you do within Datadog will persist for the life of the account (about 1 week for these accounts we've provided.)
